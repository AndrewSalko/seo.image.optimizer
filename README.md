# SEO Image Optimizer
Sample Windows application (C#) for automatic image optimization tools **jpegtran** and **optipng**, which used for losless image optimization.

Why you should care about images on your website and their optimization?
According to Google [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights)

it's strongly recommended to keep all your images optimized.
For some projects, such as [FossLook](https://fosslook.com) and [Kawaii Mobile](http://kawaii-mobile.com) I created this tool for simplified using of command-line image optimization tools.
Hope you will find it useful!
